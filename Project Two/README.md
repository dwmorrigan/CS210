#### Second Project: Airgead Bank Compounding Interest Calculator
- Guidelines for this project were to ask the user to enter an initial deposit, a monthly deposit, an interest rate, and ask for how many years to run the calculator. With that information output first the resulting yearly balance and accrued interest with only the initial deposit, then do it again but with the additional monthly deposits. Keep doing this cycle as long as the user wants.
- The style guide required max 80 char line lengths, that parameters be indicated with a "t_" and that variables use CamelCase (the worst case ever.) There were quite a few other requirements, but none that applied to the code used for this project.
